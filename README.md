Forked from https://github.com/cmdrdahkron/elite-binds and customized to my own needs.
I'm also using this repo to backup, store and share my keyboard and Thrustmaster T16k binds.

# Dahkron's Elite:Dangerous Binds

## Rationale

There are three role specific modifier buttons.  ![A](images/a_s.jpg) is for combat, ![B](images/b_s.jpg) is for ui and ![X](images/x_s.jpg) is for utilities.  That way there's one less thing for me to think about and I just know that for example holding A yields combat related actions (targeting, hardpoints, weapon groups, etc).

![Y](images/y_s.jpg) has one single purpose, which is to target ahead.

## Changes

* Added misc UI modes
* Updated xbox controls to latest game version

##### 18/07/14

* Redone all pictures with evolus/pencil, kept the source for future editing
* Added one for the buggy, I'm unhappy with vertical thruster on B (hard to open panels)
* It's ugly I know. Waiting to improve bindings before fine tuning the pictures

##### 18/07/08

* FLIGHT THRUST > VERTICAL THRUST AXIS: added small deadzone
* FLIGHT LANDING OVERRIDES: Added Forward and Backward Thrust on dpad_up and down
* FLIGHT MISCELLANEOUS: Swap "warp" binding to "Toggle Frame Shift Drive"
* MISCELLANEOUS > SHIP LIGHTS : ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg)+dpad_up
* MODE SWITCHES > AUTO FOCUS ON TEXT INPUT FIELD: off (was on)
* UPTHRUSTBUTTON: keyboard binding was W►up S►down now is R►up F►down
* Added keyboard bindings for WINGMAN and NAV LOCK (7890-)
* Rearranged the XML to match the order the game wants. Now it's easier to use a diff-tool
* Added binding for ground vehicules
* Converted to new buttons names :

##### 17/03/15

 * Added a PS4 binds file (thanks to my mate Jon!)

##### 22/01/15

* Moved jettison cargo to ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg)+RThumb as it conflicted with ship lights on the same binding. Ship lights are ![X](images/x_s.jpg)+RThumb. This puts all the 'smuggle' type actions together on ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg).
* Added ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg)+LBumper and ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg)+RBumper to set thrust to 0 and 75% respectively.
* Removed the crosshair.  Sorry, it bugged me.  You can turn it on again by switching on 'Show mouse widget' in the control options after you've loaded the preset.

##### 20/01/15

* Fixed a couple of errors on the diagrams.
